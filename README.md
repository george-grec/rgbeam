# rgbeam
This is an uglier version of [Guess my RGB](https://susam.net/myrgb.html) by Susam Pal. I made it to learn more about Gleam and Lustre.


## Development

```sh
gleam build
gleam run -m lustre/dev start --use-example-styles # Run the project
```

## Bundle
```sh
gleam run -m esgleam/bundle
```
